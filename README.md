## Acknowledgments

I highly recommend starting this challenge by focusing on mobile-first development before moving on to desktop. By prioritizing the mobile experience, we can ensure that the design is optimized for smaller screens and slower connections, which will ultimately lead to a better user experience. Once the mobile version is complete, we can then build upon it to create a desktop version that is just as polished and functional.
