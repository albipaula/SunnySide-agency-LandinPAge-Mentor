### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

## Acknowledgments

I highly recommend starting this challenge by focusing on mobile-first development before moving on to desktop. By prioritizing the mobile experience, we can ensure that the design is optimized for smaller screens and slower connections, which will ultimately lead to a better user experience. Once the mobile version is complete, we can then build upon it to create a desktop version that is just as polished and functional.
